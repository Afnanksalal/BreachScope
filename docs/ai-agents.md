# AI Multi-Agent Mode

BreachScope's AI pipeline activates automatically when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set. Each agent has a focused role and adapts behavior based on the active scan mode (`--breach`, `--bug`, or `--breach --bug`).

---

## How It Works

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
breachscope scan --mode major --url https://yourapp.com
```

1. Static scanners run first (dependency, code, toolchain, blackbox, smoke)
2. **Orchestrator Agent** reviews the project profile + scan mode and plans which AI agents to dispatch
3. Specialist agents run in sequence, each with tool access:
   - `web_search` — Firecrawl or free OSV/NVD/npm API fallback
   - `crawl_url` — scrape specific advisory/changelog pages
   - HTTP tools — live requests to the target or registry APIs
4. **Report Agent** synthesizes all findings, identifies attack chains, writes executive summary

## Mode Awareness

| Mode | Orchestrator bias | Code agent focus | Dep agent focus |
|------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| `all` | Balanced dispatch | Broad vulnerability classes | Top 15 risky packages across all ecosystems |
| `breach` | Dependency + toolchain heavy | Credential hunt — keys, tokens, infra exposure | 20+ packages: hijacks, malware, CVEs, typosquatting (all ecosystems) |
| `bug` | Code heavy, skip toolchain | Deep logic bugs — race conditions, IDOR, deserialization | Reachable CVEs in auth/parsing/HTTP packages (all ecosystems) |
| `full` | Everything runs | Both bug + breach combined | Aggressive + reachable CVEs, 25+ packages (all ecosystems) |

---

## Agents

### Orchestrator

Plans the attack. Reads the project profile (dependencies, file list, toolchain credentials present, URL, scan mode) and returns a JSON dispatch plan. Falls back to a deterministic plan (no AI) if parsing fails.

**Breach mode fallback**: always includes `dependency + code + toolchain (if creds present) + blackbox (if URL)`  
**Bug mode fallback**: always includes `code + dependency`  
**Full mode fallback**: everything

### Dependency Agent

Researches packages across **all 10 ecosystems** using live tools — npm, PyPI, Go, crates.io, RubyGems, Maven, Packagist, NuGet, Hex, pub. Each lookup uses the correct ecosystem tag for accurate CVE matching.

Tools available:
- `fetch_osv_data(package, ecosystem)` — queries OSV.dev directly with the correct ecosystem
- `fetch_github_advisory(package, ecosystem)` — GitHub Security Advisories per ecosystem
- `search_vulnerabilities(package, ecosystem)` — targeted web search for CVEs and supply chain incidents
- `web_search` — broader incident research (HackTricks, Snyk, Socket.dev, Exploit-DB)
- `crawl_url` — fetches specific advisory pages, NVD CVE entries, registry pages

The agent receives all detected packages grouped by ecosystem and is instructed to pass the correct ecosystem identifier to every lookup call.

**In breach mode**: Investigates 20+ packages aggressively across all ecosystems. Looks for active malware, postinstall script exfiltration, maintainer takeovers, typosquatting, dependency confusion.

**In bug mode**: Cross-references installed versions against known-vulnerable version ranges. Focuses on packages in auth, parsing, and HTTP handling paths.

**In full mode**: Combines both — 25+ packages, breach hunting + CVE cross-reference.

### Code Agent

Deep static analysis with GPT-4o. Sends prioritized source files (auth, routes, DB, config first) and reasons about the full codebase.

**In breach mode** (`SYSTEM_BREACH` prompt): Hunts exclusively for credentials, secrets, and misconfigurations that give attackers immediate access.

**In bug mode** (`SYSTEM_BUG` prompt): Finds real exploitable security bugs — second-order injection, race conditions in auth flows, prototype pollution chains, subtle SSRF patterns, insecure deserialization, business logic flaws.

**In full mode**: Both prompts merged — credential hunt + deep code vulnerability research simultaneously.

### Toolchain Agent

Fetches live changelogs from Supabase, Vercel, and GitHub. Searches for recent breach patterns, OAuth flow risks, webhook abuse vectors, and cross-tool attack chains. Runs in `breach` and `full` modes.

### Blackbox Agent

HTTP-level penetration tester. Makes targeted requests to the live URL, tests specific attack paths flagged by static scanners, identifies tech stack from response headers. Runs when `--url` is provided.

### Report Agent

CISO-grade synthesis — always runs last. Identifies attack chains (A + B + C = account takeover), writes executive summary and prioritized action list.

---

## Sandbox Agents

The `breachscope sandbox` command runs an additional three specialized agents on top of the main attack loop.

### Sandbox Supervisor

Runs before the main exploit loop. Receives all recon data (discovered credentials, endpoints, open ports, framework versions) and produces a prioritized `SpecialistTask[]` attack plan.

- Performs targeted web searches for known CVEs against detected framework/library versions
- Produces tasks with exact context: endpoint paths, parameter names, credential values, chained hypotheses
- Falls back gracefully if recon data is insufficient (skips with a log entry rather than burning tokens)
- Max 6 tasks per session — quality over quantity

### Sandbox Validator

Runs after the main attack loop. Independently re-verifies every critical and high finding by re-running replication steps from scratch.

- Skeptical by default: must reproduce the same evidence to confirm
- Confidence levels: `confirmed` (≥90/100), `likely` (60–89), `uncertain` (30–59), `false_positive` (<30)
- Results annotated onto findings in the dashboard: confidence badge + score
- Caps at 5 validations per session to control token use
- Medium/low findings skipped (auto-assigned `likely` / 70 score)

### CVE Intelligence (`cve-intel.ts`)

Triggered whenever a CVE ID is found during dependency scanning or live attack. Fetches in parallel:

| Signal | Source | What it provides |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| EPSS score | FIRST.org API | Exploitation probability in 30 days (0–100%) |
| CVSS + severity | NVD API | Base score, vector string, severity label |
| Nuclei template | projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates | Exploit-ready template available? |
| Exploit-DB entry | Reference URL matching | Public PoC / exploit exists? |

EPSS risk classification: 🔴 >50% (HIGH) · 🟡 10–50% (MEDIUM) · 🟢 <10% (LOW). Displayed inline in agent output and batch CVE reports.

## Live Service Probing

With an interactive terminal (`stdin.isTTY`), BreachScope discovers SaaS services in your codebase and prompts for credentials to probe them live:

```bash
breachscope scan
```

```
Detected 3 service(s) in your codebase:
● Supabase (database)
● GitHub (vcs)
● Stripe (payments)

Probe live Supabase environment? [y/N]
  Project URL: ...
  Anon Key: ...
```

Every API call made by the probe agent is logged step-by-step and sent to the dashboard with HTTP method badges (GET/POST/PATCH), search labels (SRCH), and crawl labels (CRAWL).

In CI (`stdin.isTTY === false`), the interactive live service probe is skipped automatically.

---

## Free Threat Intelligence

When `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` is not set, BreachScope falls back to free public APIs automatically:

- **OSV.dev** — comprehensive open vulnerability database (POST API, no key required)
- **npm advisory bulk API** — security advisories with affected version ranges
- **NVD CVE search** — NIST national vulnerability database keyword search

Firecrawl enables full web search when available but is never required.

---

## Requirements

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-...  # optional — free APIs used as fallback
```

Or add to `breachscope.yaml`:

```yaml
ai:
  openaiApiKey: ""    # or OPENAI_API_KEY
  firecrawlApiKey: "" # optional
  model: gpt-4o
```

Keys stored on the dashboard (Settings page) are encrypted with AES-256-GCM and auto-injected into CLI sessions.
